                What began as my great-grandfather’s hotel continues to thrive as a timeless experience for today’s guests. Since 1895, the Secret Garden Hotel has had the natural beauty of the mountains and the majestic house and gardens to beguile us, inspire us, and allow us to escape from the everyday.
                <br />
                <br />
                The Secret Garden Hotel is still family-owned, and we are still passionate about our mission of preservation through self-sufficiency—a philosophy embraced before the first stone was ever placed.
                <br />
                <br />
                We remain self-sustaining through innovation, creative thinking, and listening to guests who continue to tell us they want more ways to connect with the Secret Garden Hotel. Wine was our first foray into offering a taste of the Secret Garden Hotel; now, you can experience life as a guest of our family at our four-star Hotel. You can also reimagine your own surroundings with a line of home furnishings, bedding and bath items, and gourmet foods.
                <br />
                <br />
                Just as first envisioned, the Secret Garden Hotel is all about home—welcoming and celebrating family and friends, and extending the spirit of the Secret Garden Hotel beyond our 8,000 acres. It was true in 1895, and it remains true today.
